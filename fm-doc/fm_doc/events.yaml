#
#   Other Notes:
#      - use general record format above
#      - the only dictionaries allowed are ones indexed by severity
#      - if there are multiple lists in a record,
#        then they should all have the same # of items and corresponding list items represent instance of alarm
#      - if you can't describe the alarm/log based on the above rules,
#        then you can use a multi-line string format
#      - DELETING alarms from events.yaml: alarms should only be deleted when going to a new Titanium Cloud release
#      - if all possible alarm severities are mgmt affecting, the convention is to
#        use 'warning' as the Management_Affecting_Severity, even if warning is not a possible severity for that alarm
#
#   Testing:
#      - Testing of events.yaml can be done by running regular make command
#        and specifying fm-doc:
#                nice -n 20 ionice -c Idle make -C build fm-doc.rebuild
#      - When building, events.yaml will be parsed for correct format, and also
#        to ensure that Alarm IDs defined in constants.py and fmAlarm.h are
#        listed in events.yaml
